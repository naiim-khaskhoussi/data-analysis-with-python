# Data Analysis using Python


## Description
This course will take you from the basics of Python to exploring many different types of data. You will learn how to prepare data for analysis, perform simple statistical analyses, create meaningful data visualizations, predict future trends from data, and more! 

This course still available on [IBM Cognitive Class](https://cognitiveclass.ai/courses/data-analysis-python/)


## Requirements
* Python 3
* Install all dependencies before start using this project.
  I had prepared all of thoes dependencies, so you can install all of them by running:
